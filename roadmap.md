# Fix React State - Project Roadmap

## Project Vision
Create a powerful static analysis tool that helps React developers identify and fix state management antipatterns, promoting best practices and improving code quality.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
**Working on:** Setting up project tracking and roadmap
**Next up:** Implement "Avoid Deeply Nested State" rule

## Current Status (as of August 2024)

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Core infrastructure setup
  - [x] TypeScript configuration
  - [x] CLI with commander.js
  - [x] AST parsing with Babel
  - [x] Testing with Vitest
  - [x] ESLint and Prettier configuration
  
- [x] Rule Implementation (3/6)
  - [x] Group Related State - Detects multiple useState calls that should be combined
  - [x] Avoid State Contradictions - Identifies boolean states that can conflict
  - [x] Avoid Redundant State - Finds state that can be computed
  
- [x] Output Formats
  - [x] Text output with colors
  - [x] JSON output for programmatic use
  - [x] Markdown output for reports
  
- [x] Test Coverage
  - [x] Unit tests for all implemented rules
  - [x] Test fixtures with good/bad examples

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Additional rule implementations

### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming Tasks

#### Phase 1: Complete Core Rules (High Priority)

**Avoid Deeply Nested State Rule**
- [ ] Create rule file `src/rules/avoid-deeply-nested-state.ts`
- [ ] Implement detection logic for nested state (>2 levels)
- [ ] Add suggestion for flattening/normalization
- [ ] Create test fixtures with examples
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Update rules index

**Avoid State Duplication Rule**
- [ ] Create rule file `src/rules/avoid-state-duplication.ts`
- [ ] Implement detection for duplicated state from props
- [ ] Implement detection for duplicated state across components
- [ ] Add suggestion for single source of truth
- [ ] Create test fixtures with examples
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Update rules index

**Prefer Explicit State Transitions Rule**
- [ ] Create rule file `src/rules/prefer-explicit-transitions.ts`
- [ ] Detect multiple useState calls that update together
- [ ] Analyze for complex state logic patterns
- [ ] Suggest useReducer migration
- [ ] Add XState recommendation for complex cases
- [ ] Create test fixtures with examples
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Update rules index

#### Phase 2: Real-World Testing (Medium Priority)

**Example Applications**
- [ ] Create `examples/` directory
- [ ] Create todo app with antipatterns
- [ ] Create shopping cart example
- [ ] Create complex form example
- [ ] Add README for each example
- [ ] Add npm scripts to test examples

**Testing on Real Projects**
- [ ] Test on popular React repos
- [ ] Document findings
- [ ] Create issue templates for feedback

#### Phase 3: Developer Experience (Medium Priority)

**Auto-fix Functionality**
- [ ] Add `--fix` flag implementation
- [ ] Implement fix for group-related-state
- [ ] Implement fix for avoid-contradictions
- [ ] Implement fix for avoid-redundant-state
- [ ] Add dry-run mode
- [ ] Add interactive fix mode

**Editor Integration**
- [ ] Create VS Code extension scaffold
- [ ] Implement language server protocol
- [ ] Add quick fix code actions
- [ ] Create extension documentation

**Tool Integration**
- [ ] Create ESLint plugin wrapper
- [ ] Add Prettier compatibility
- [ ] Create webpack plugin
- [ ] Create rollup plugin

#### Phase 4: CI/CD & Distribution (Medium Priority)

**GitHub Actions**
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] Add test runner action
- [ ] Add coverage reporting
- [ ] Add lint checks
- [ ] Add type checking
- [ ] Create release workflow
- [ ] Add npm publish automation

**npm Publishing**
- [ ] Add prepublish scripts
- [ ] Create `.npmignore`
- [ ] Set up semantic versioning
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Add release scripts
- [ ] Test local npm install

**Documentation**
- [ ] Set up docs site (Docusaurus/VitePress)
- [ ] Write getting started guide
- [ ] Document each rule in detail
- [ ] Add interactive playground
- [ ] Create video tutorials

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- [ ] Custom rule API
  - Allow users to define project-specific rules
  - Plugin system for community rules
- [ ] Performance optimizations
  - Incremental analysis
  - Caching for large codebases
- [ ] Framework support expansion
  - Next.js specific patterns
  - React Native considerations
  - Remix adaptations

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of npm downloads
- **Impact**: Issues caught and fixed in real projects
- **Community**: GitHub stars, contributors, and rule suggestions
- **Quality**: Test coverage > 90%, zero false positives

## Technical Decisions

### Why These Technologies?
- **Babel**: Most robust JavaScript/TypeScript parser
- **Commander**: Simple, well-documented CLI framework
- **Vitest**: Fast, modern test runner with great DX
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for better rule accuracy

### Rule Philosophy
1. **No false positives**: Better to miss issues than flag correct code
2. **Actionable feedback**: Every issue should have a clear fix
3. **Educational**: Help developers understand the "why"
4. **Incremental adoption**: Work on any codebase, any size

## Contributing Guidelines
1. Each rule should have:
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Clear documentation
   - Real-world examples
   - Performance benchmarks

2. New features require:
   - Discussion in GitHub issues first
   - Tests before implementation
   - Documentation updates
   - Changelog entry

## Long-term Vision
Eventually, fix-react-state could become:
- The standard tool for React state management linting
- Integrated into create-react-app and other bootstrapping tools
- A learning resource for React best practices
- Part of the broader React ecosystem toolchain
