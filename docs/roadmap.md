# Better React State - Project Roadmap

## Project Vision

Create a powerful static analysis tool that helps React developers identify and fix state management antipatterns, promoting best practices and improving code quality.

This document tracks all implemented and planned rules for the better-react-state analyzer. It serves as both a historical record and a planning tool for future development.

## Rating Criteria

- **Commonality**: How frequently this pattern appears in React codebases (1-5, 5 being most common)
- **Priority**: Implementation priority considering effort, value, and strategic fit (1-5, 5 being highest)
- **ESLint Coverage**: Whether existing ESLint rules already address this pattern

## Rules Overview

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Value, Unique Rules (Priority 5)

Focus on rules that aren't covered by existing tools and provide clear value:

1. **Prop Drilling Detection** - Very common, no existing tooling
2. **State in useEffect** - Subtle bugs, often misunderstood

### Phase 2: Architecture & Performance (Priority 4)

Rules that guide better architectural decisions:

1. **Server vs Client State** - Push toward React Query/SWR adoption
2. **State in useEffect** - Better detection than exhaustive-deps for derived state

### Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (Priority 3)

Nice-to-have rules for code quality:

1. **State vs Refs** - Performance optimization
2. **Form State Patterns** - Developer experience
3. **State Machine Detection** - Advanced pattern recognition
4. **Global State Overuse** - Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Lower Priority (Priority 1)

Consider if there's strong user demand:

1. **State Update Batching** - Less relevant in modern React

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of issues detected and fixed
- **False Positive Rate**: Keep below 10%
- **Developer Feedback**: Usefulness ratings
- **Performance**: Analysis speed on large codebases

## Future Considerations

### ESLint Plugin Development

Transform this analyzer into an ESLint plugin (`eslint-plugin-better-react-state`):

**Advantages:**

- Integrate into existing developer workflows
- Real-time feedback in IDEs
- Leverage ESLint's auto-fix infrastructure
- Shareable configs for teams
- Better adoption through familiar tooling

**Implementation Plan:**

1. Start with rules that have no ESLint equivalent (Priority 5 rules)
2. Provide better messages/suggestions than existing partial coverage
3. Bundle as `@better-react-state/eslint-plugin`
4. Maintain standalone CLI for project-wide analysis and reporting

**Target Rules for ESLint:**

- All 6 implemented rules (none have ESLint equivalents)
- Prop Drilling Detection (high value, no existing rule)
- State in useEffect (better than exhaustive-deps for this case)
- Server vs Client State (architectural guidance)

### Potential Auto-fix Support

Some rules could support automatic fixes:

- Group Related State (combine useState calls)
- Avoid Redundant State (remove state, add computation)
- State vs Refs (convert useState to useRef)
- Avoid State Contradictions (convert to single state variable)

### Framework-Specific Rules

Consider rules for:

- Next.js (client vs server state)
- Remix (loader data vs client state)
- React Native (performance-critical state patterns)

### Integration with XState

Since XState is already detected, consider:

- Suggesting XState for complex state logic
- XState-specific best practices
- Migration paths from useState/useReducer to XState

## Contributing

When proposing new rules, consider:

1. Is this a React state-specific issue?
2. Does it cause actual bugs or just style preferences?
3. Is it already well-covered by existing tools?
4. Can we provide actionable fix suggestions?
5. Will it have too many false positives?

## Current Status (as of August 2024)

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Core infrastructure setup
  - TypeScript configuration
  - CLI with commander.js
  - AST parsing with Babel
  - Testing with Vitest
  - ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Rule Implementation (6/6) ‚úÖ
  - Group Related State - Detects multiple useState calls that should be combined
  - Avoid State Contradictions - Identifies boolean states that can conflict
  - Avoid Redundant State - Finds state that can be computed
  - Avoid Deeply Nested State - Detects state nested more than 2-3 levels deep
  - Avoid State Duplication - Detects state that duplicates props or other state
  - Prefer Explicit State Transitions - Suggests useReducer for complex multi-state updates
- Output Formats
  - Text output with colors
  - JSON output for programmatic use
  - Markdown output for reports
- Test Coverage
  - Unit tests for all implemented rules
  - Test fixtures with good/bad examples

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 0: Complete Core Features (High Priority)

**Example Applications** ([#36](https://github.com/kevinmaes/better-react-state/issues/36))

- [ ] Create `examples/` directory
- [ ] Create todo app with antipatterns
- [ ] Create shopping cart example
- [ ] Create complex form example
- [ ] Add README for each example
- [ ] Add npm scripts to test examples

**Testing on Real Projects** ([#37](https://github.com/kevinmaes/better-react-state/issues/37))

- [ ] Test on popular React repos
- [ ] Document findings
- [ ] Create issue templates for feedback

**Auto-fix Functionality** ([#2](https://github.com/kevinmaes/better-react-state/issues/2))

- [ ] Add `--fix` flag implementation
- [ ] Implement fix for group-related-state
- [ ] Implement fix for avoid-contradictions
- [ ] Implement fix for avoid-redundant-state
- [ ] Add dry-run mode
- [ ] Add interactive fix mode

## Technical Decisions

### Why These Technologies?

- **Babel**: Most robust JavaScript/TypeScript parser
- **Commander**: Simple, well-documented CLI framework
- **Vitest**: Fast, modern test runner with great DX
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for better rule accuracy

### Rule Philosophy

1. **No false positives**: Better to miss issues than flag correct code
2. **Actionable feedback**: Every issue should have a clear fix
3. **Educational**: Help developers understand the "why"
4. **Incremental adoption**: Work on any codebase, any size

## Long-term Vision

Eventually, better-react-state could become:

- The standard tool for React state management linting
- Integrated into create-react-app and other bootstrapping tools
- A learning resource for React best practices
- Part of the broader React ecosystem toolchain
