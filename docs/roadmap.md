# Better React State - Rules Roadmap

This document tracks all implemented and planned rules for the better-react-state analyzer. It serves as both a historical record and a planning tool for future development.

## Rating Criteria

- **Commonality**: How frequently this pattern appears in React codebases (1-5, 5 being most common)
- **Priority**: Implementation priority considering effort, value, and strategic fit (1-5, 5 being highest)
- **ESLint Coverage**: Whether existing ESLint rules already address this pattern

## Rules Overview

### ‚úÖ Implemented Rules

These rules are currently active in the analyzer (sorted by priority):

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Value, Unique Rules (Priority 5)

Focus on rules that aren't covered by existing tools and provide clear value:

1. **Prop Drilling Detection** - Very common, no existing tooling
2. **State in useEffect** - Subtle bugs, often misunderstood

### Phase 2: Architecture & Performance (Priority 4)

Rules that guide better architectural decisions:

1. **Server vs Client State** - Push toward React Query/SWR adoption
2. **State in useEffect** - Better detection than exhaustive-deps for derived state

### Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (Priority 3)

Nice-to-have rules for code quality:

1. **State vs Refs** - Performance optimization
2. **Form State Patterns** - Developer experience
3. **State Machine Detection** - Advanced pattern recognition
4. **Global State Overuse** - Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Lower Priority (Priority 1)

Consider if there's strong user demand:

1. **State Update Batching** - Less relevant in modern React

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of issues detected and fixed
- **False Positive Rate**: Keep below 10%
- **Developer Feedback**: Usefulness ratings
- **Performance**: Analysis speed on large codebases

## Future Considerations

### ESLint Plugin Development

Transform this analyzer into an ESLint plugin (`eslint-plugin-better-react-state`):

**Advantages:**

- Integrate into existing developer workflows
- Real-time feedback in IDEs
- Leverage ESLint's auto-fix infrastructure
- Shareable configs for teams
- Better adoption through familiar tooling

**Implementation Plan:**

1. Start with rules that have no ESLint equivalent (Priority 5 rules)
2. Provide better messages/suggestions than existing partial coverage
3. Bundle as `@better-react-state/eslint-plugin`
4. Maintain standalone CLI for project-wide analysis and reporting

**Target Rules for ESLint:**

- All 6 implemented rules (none have ESLint equivalents)
- Prop Drilling Detection (high value, no existing rule)
- State in useEffect (better than exhaustive-deps for this case)
- Server vs Client State (architectural guidance)

### Potential Auto-fix Support

Some rules could support automatic fixes:

- Group Related State (combine useState calls)
- Avoid Redundant State (remove state, add computation)
- State vs Refs (convert useState to useRef)
- Avoid State Contradictions (convert to single state variable)

### Framework-Specific Rules

Consider rules for:

- Next.js (client vs server state)
- Remix (loader data vs client state)
- React Native (performance-critical state patterns)

### Integration with XState

Since XState is already detected, consider:

- Suggesting XState for complex state logic
- XState-specific best practices
- Migration paths from useState/useReducer to XState

## Contributing

When proposing new rules, consider:

1. Is this a React state-specific issue?
2. Does it cause actual bugs or just style preferences?
3. Is it already well-covered by existing tools?
4. Can we provide actionable fix suggestions?
5. Will it have too many false positives?

## Changelog

### 2024-01

- Initial 6 rules implemented
- XState detection added
- JSON and Markdown output formats

### Future

- See planned rules above
